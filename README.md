# SynACSF
(Outdated) Patcher for using Alternate Custom Skills Framework

# Why is it outdated?
Because the original framework is updated. Unless you have a active playthrough you do not need this, nor will I support this any longer.
DO NOT DM ME ON NEXUS TO HAVE IT UNHIDDEN, YOU WILL BE BLOCKED / IGNORED.
I will only support the latest version of Skyrim: Anniversary Edition on steam which at the time of writing is 1.6.640
This policy is the same as the USSEP team and many other modders on the nexus.
